# Agent Guidelines for Codebase Interaction

This document outlines the conventions and commands for agents operating within this repository.

## 1. Build, Lint, and Test Commands

- **General Test Command:** `bun test:unit`
- **Run a Single Test:** `bun test:unit <path/to/your/test-file.spec.ts>`
- **Linting:**
  - For `.js`, `.ts`, `.json`, `.jsonc` files: `bun run biome check --apply`
  - For `.vue` files: `bun run format`
- **Building:** `bun run build`
- **Type Checking:** `bun run type-check`

## 2. Code Style Guidelines

### Auto-Imports

The project uses `unplugin-auto-import` to automatically manage imports for Vue, Vue Router, and Pinia. It also auto-imports composables and stores from `src/composables`, `src/components` , and `src/stores` directories. This means you do not need to manually import functions like `ref`, `computed`, `defineStore`, etc., in your Vue components.

### Formatting

- **TypeScript/JavaScript:** The project uses Biome for formatting `.js`, `.ts`, `.json`, and `.jsonc` files. The configuration is likely set in `biome.json`. Key style points are:
  - 2-space indentation.
  - 80-character line width.
  - Double quotes for strings.
  - Always semicolons.
  - Always parentheses for arrow functions.
  - Bracket spacing.
- **Vue:** Prettier is used for formatting `.vue` files. The configuration is in `prettier.config.js`. Key style points are:
  - 2-space indentation.
  - No tabs.
  - Single quotes are false (so double quotes are used).
  - Always semicolons.
  - Trailing commas for es5.

### Aliases

The project uses the `@` alias for the `src` directory. You should use this alias when importing modules from the `src` directory (e.g., `import MyComponent from '@/components/MyComponent.vue'`).

### Types

- Use type hints consistently for functions, variables, and class members where applicable.
- Do not explicitly write the return types of functions; let TypeScript infer them.

### Naming Conventions

- Adhere to existing project conventions. For example, Vue components are in `PascalCase`, and composables are in `camelCase`.

### Error Handling & Comments

- Adhere to existing project conventions for error handling.
- Add comments sparingly, focusing on _why_ complex logic is implemented, not _what_ it does.

### Modularity

- Break down large functions and classes into smaller, focused units. This is evident in the use of composables and stores.

## 3. Tool Usage Conventions

- **Node.js Package Manager:** Always use `bun` instead of `npm` for all Node.js related operations (e.g., `bun install`, `bun run`, `bun test`).
- **Executing Binaries:** Use `bunx` instead of `npx`.
- **Git Commits:** To commit changes using Git, use the `ac` command. This command does not accept any arguments; the commit message is automatically generated by the system. To commit and push changes to main branch, use `acp` instead.

## 4. Agent Identity

You are opencode, specifically sst/opencode. If you want to see the documentation about yourself, please use Context7 with `sst/opencode` as the search term.
